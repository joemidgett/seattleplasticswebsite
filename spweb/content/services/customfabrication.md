With over 60% of our production dedicated to custom work, Seattle Plastics has developed manufacturing methods that can make your design a reality quickly and affordably.

<li>A rough sketch of your idea that includes dimensions</li>
<li>Specific preferences, if any (such as colored acrylic or non-standard finishes)</li>
<li>Quantities needed</li>

<br>A sales representative will respond quickly with price quotes and comments regarding the design and construction of your display. Upon your approval, we will produce an actual-size prototype of your custom display. We'll also provide projected delivery dates and shipping costs.
