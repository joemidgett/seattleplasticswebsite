Seattle Plastics is pleased to present our new line of plastic chalkboard products for the retail market.

Made from FDA approved acrylic, our items have a matte finish to mimic a chalkboard's surface which can be fabricated into any product from slanted signs for deli cases, signs for bottle tops, gift card displays, tip jars and more. Unlike real chalkboard, it's lightweight and cleans easily with any surface cleaner. Like chalkboard, it can be used with liquid chalk, dry erase pens, real chalk or new dry erase crayons from Crayola to create beautiful, professional sign holders. The options are endless.

New sizes and items are being developed so check back again to see our new additions. Please contact us for custom sizes and check out our new chalkboard gift card display.
